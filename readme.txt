This code is a Python program that allows users to input an NBA player's name and a year, and it retrieves and displays information about that player's performance during a specific NBA season.

Here's a summary of the code's functionality:

Installation of Required Packages: The code starts by installing several Python packages using pip, including nba_api, wikipedia, lxml, ipywidgets, and others. These packages provide functionalities such as accessing NBA data, web scraping, and creating interactive widgets.

Imports: The code imports various Python modules and libraries needed for its functionality. These include requests for making HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, pandas for data manipulation, and more.

Main Program:

The code begins by displaying a title and a small description.
It obtains the current year using the datetime module for error handling purposes.
The program then enters a loop to prompt the user to input a year for which they want to retrieve NBA player statistics. It checks if the input is a valid year and whether the NBA existed before that year. The loop continues until valid input is provided.
After obtaining a valid year, the user is prompted to enter an NBA player's first and last name.
The code constructs a URL based on the provided year and then uses web scraping (BeautifulSoup and urlopen) to extract NBA player statistics data from the specified URL.
The extracted data is stored in a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
The code removes asterisks from player names (which indicate players who have played for multiple teams in one season) to facilitate user input.
It then filters the DataFrame to find the statistics of the player entered by the user.
The code retrieves and displays the player's points per game (PPG), rebounds per game (RPG), assists per game (APG), and a brief summary of the player from Wikipedia.
Finally, it displays a table of additional player statistics, including position, age, and more.
Error Handling: If the user enters a year for which there is no NBA data, the program displays an appropriate error message.

Overall, this code is designed to provide information about an NBA player's performance during a specific season based on user input. It leverages web scraping to gather NBA statistics and Wikipedia for player information.
