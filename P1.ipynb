    "## Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary objectives for the project are to create something novel, useful and innovative with Python code. You can draw your inspiration from the many examples given to you throughout the semester. Your project should clearly and explicitly demonstrate the level of programming knowledge that you have acquired in this course. The type of project you propose is up to you. Ultimately you are evaluated based on not only the idea itself but your execution of it, therefore your **project should be a representaiton of you and your abilities as a programmer.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our role is to help you to scope your idea. If it is simple enough we will expect a full implementation, if it’s complex then we’ll ask for a manifestation of your idea as a minimum viable product. It should be a proof of concept demonstrating how the bigger system might work. That being said, it is important to engage your small group instructor as they are the evaluator of your work. It can only make your project and your grade better.\n"

    "### Starting Your Code Journal\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most valuable things you can do for yourself as a programmer is start a code journal. Each time you work on the project include the date, number of hours worked and a summary what you did. The most important part of your journal should be the comments. What did you do? Did you finish it? What issues are outstanding? What questions do you have? Did you hit any dead-ends? How did you work around the problem? Are you stuck? What are you stuck on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time before you start work on your project review the last entry of your journal to remind you of where you left off! When you embrace journaling you'll discover many valuable uses for it. I love it simply for all the things I don't have to try to keep in my head between coding sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the best possible grade on your project, then you will have to maintain a regular code journal. It should include routine contributions you've made to the project. I have written an interactive journal as a Python program. Using the journal is simple. just Open `CodeJournal.ipynb` and run the code cell.\n",

    "**IMPORTANT**: You should start journaling your project activity NOW as you complete P1.\n",

    "`My project idea is a player information book/ comparison program for the NBA. I want to make a really visually appealing program that shows the data assosicated with NBA players. So for example, if someone wanted to get information on an NBA player, they would type in their name ex. Jayson Tatum. The program would then take the bio from googles information card, or some other source and start the information display off with it. The program would then Output things such as his stats for this specific season, his career stats, and his career accolades. I would also then make it so that you can continue to enter players, either to get their individual information, or to compare them to the last player entered. `\n",
