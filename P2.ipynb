So for example, if someone wanted to get information on an NBA player, they would type in their name ex. Jayson Tatum. The program would then take the bio from googles information card, or some other source and start the information display off with it. The program would then Output things such as his stats for this specific season, his career stats, and his career accolades. I would also then make it so that you can continue to enter players, either to get their individual information, or to compare them to the last player entered. `\n",
